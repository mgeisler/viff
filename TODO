TODO list for pysmpc. Roughly ordered in order of priority.

* Seeds from command line, program uses random seed (and prints it!)
  otherwise.

* Rewrite runtime to facilitate unit tests.

* Benchmark Python vs. GMPY on different key sizes.

* Profile and optimize.

* Rework the pc facility.

* Add global debug option which will fix random seeds instead of
   having them hardwired to zero.

* Have an option which will make things run more or less sequentially.

* Provide a small install-daimi.sh shell script which will set up
  PYTHONPATH corrrectly for people on DAIMI?
