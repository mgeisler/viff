PySMPC: Python Secure Multi-Party Computation
=============================================

This is a general framework for doing secure multi-party computations.


Configuring the Environment
---------------------------

On DAIMI you can simply run the install-daimi.sh script:

  % sh install-daimi.dk

It will attempt to configure the environment for you. If that fails,
then please follow the generic instructions below:

To run pysmpc you must configure your Python path correctly by setting
the PYTHONPATH environment variable. In Bash shells this is done by

  % export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/pysmpc/checkout

If you have checked out pysmpc to ~/pysmpc, then do

  % export PYTHONPATH=~/pysmpc

Requirements:

  * Twisted:   http://twistedmatrix.com/
  * ConfigObj: http://voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html
  * GMPY:      http://gmpy.sourceforge.net/

On DAIMI these modules have been installed into

  ~mg/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages

and so one can simply access them by appending that directory to
PYTHONPATH, e.g., putting these three lines

  PYTHONPATH=/path/to/pysmpc/checkout
  PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~mg/opt/lib/python2.4/site-packages
  export PYTHONPATH

into a new file called pysmpc.rc under ~/.daimi-setup/bash/bashrc.d/.


Example Applications
--------------------

The apps directory contains a number of example apps. They require
player configuration files to be generated in advance, use
pysmpc/generate_config.py for that. Then execute three players,
starting with player 3, then 2 and finally 1.
